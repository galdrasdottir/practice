A small game where the player visits a market and trades items from their pocket
until they have completed their shopping list. The player can freely move between stalls
and stallholders will react when they have the correct item in their inventory,
but the player has to figure out what piece they are interested in.


Consists of:

a map with several stalls
	- central square
	- bakery (squirrel)
	- vegetable stall (gnome)
	- trinket stall (crow)
	- magic toad
	- goat

movement enginge between places
	- opening scene
	- entering scenes
	- exiting scenes
	- dictionary of places

inventory system
	- check pockets
	- stallholder react to items
	- trading & changing contents


Further ideas:
- pull new inventory (and/or shopping list?) from a list for every play, several paths
- item through player input with randomly assigned value
